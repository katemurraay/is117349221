     <button class ="accordion">Software as a Service (SaaS) - Salesforce</button>
     <div class= "panel">
     <p>Software as a service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which third-party providers host applications and makes them available to customers over the Internet. SaaS is one of three main categories of cloud computing, alongside infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).</p>
     <p>Saas means there is no longer a need for organisations to install and run applications on their computers or in their data centres.  Therefore, there is no longer a need to purchase expensive hardware, as well as software licensing, installation and support. Instead of purchasing software to install, or additional hardware to support it, customers subscribe to a SaaS offering. Thus, allowing customers to make flexible payments monthly using a pay-as-you-go model. This allows many businesses to exercise better and more predictable budgeting. Users can also terminate SaaS offerings at any time to stop those recurring costs.</p>

     <h4>Salesforce</h4>
     <p>Salesforce is the number 1 Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform. Using a simple login its cloud-based applications for sales, service, marketing, and more, enables business to connecting to customers in a whole new way.</p>

     <button class ="accordion">Platform as a Service (PaaS) - Cloud9</button>
     <div class="panel">
     <p>Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model in which a third-party provider delivers hardware and software tools to users over the internet. A PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure which stops users from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application.  </p>
     <p>The primary benefit of PaaS is simplicity and convenience for users. Users can access infrastructure and other IT services anywhere via a web browser. Users can install applications and data sets on a resilient and optimized environment without having to construct and maintain the underlying infrastructure and services. </p>

     <h4>Cloud9</h4>
     
    <p>Cloud9 provides a computing platform and/or solution stack typically including operating system, programming language execution environment, database, and web server. Application developers can develop and run their software solutions on a cloud platform without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layers.</p> 
    <p>It also offers a seamless experience for developing serverless applications allowing users to easily define resources, debug, and switch between local and remote execution of serverless applications. </p>
    </div>
    <button class ="accordion">Infrastructure as a Serivce (IaaS) - Amazon Web Services</button>
    <div class ="panel">
    <p>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a form of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. IaaS is one of the three main categories of cloud computing services, alongside software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).
In an IaaS model, a cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components traditionally present in an on-premises data center, including servers, storage and networking hardware, as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer.
</p>
<p>The IaaS provider also supplies a range of services including detailed billing, monitoring, log access, security, load balancing and clustering, as well as storage resiliency, such as backup, replication and recovery. These services are increasingly policy-driven, enabling IaaS users to implement greater levels of automation and orchestration for important infrastructure tasks. IaaS customers access resources and services through a wide area network (WAN), such as the internet, and can use the cloud provider's services to install the remaining elements of an application stack. Users can then use the provider's services to track costs, monitor performance, balance network traffic, troubleshoot application issues, manage disaster recovery etc.
</p>
<p>
     IaaS is often easier, faster and more cost-efficient to operate a workload without having to buy, manage and support the underlying infrastructure. With IaaS, a business can simply rent or lease that infrastructure from another business.

    <button class ="accordion">Communications as a Service (CaaS) - Gmail</button>
    <div class ="panel">
    <p>Communications as a Service (CaaS) provides Software as a Service (SaaS) for communications. There is no standard specification as to what is included in CaaS. Implementations vary. It includes unified communications, broadcasting, individual calls (voice and video), conferencing (voice and video), voice over IP (VoIP), messaging etc.</p>
     <p>CaaS offers flexibility which is particularly useful for small and medium-sized business that may not otherwise afford. The network capacity and feature set can be changed from day to day if necessary so that functionality keeps pace with demand. There is no risk of the system becoming obsolete and requiring periodic major upgrades or replacement.</p>
